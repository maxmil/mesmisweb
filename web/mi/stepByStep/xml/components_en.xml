	<literal>REFORESTED AREAS</literal>
	<subsystem>2</subsystem>
	<description>Each farmer assigns, on average, 13 hectares of his land to reforestation. Most of these lands are hillsides and slopes where agriculture has ceased because of excessive soil erosion and nutrient depletion. Reforestations are 1 to 15 years old and subsidized by federal and state programs. In general, the establishment and maintenance of these areas employ family labor. </description>

	<description>Cattle provide dairy products, beef, and animal power for agricultural labors and transportation of products. They also function as a sort of savings account; in case of need, animals are sold to regional slaughterhouses. A head of cattle is ready for sale after a 3-year fattening period. </description>

	<literal>FAMILY</literal>
	<subsystem>4</subsystem>
	<description>An average family has 6 members. The family structure responds to a strong patriarchy, which is strengthened as the land-owning rights are traditionally assigned exclusively to the head of the family (usually the father). Nonetheless, in recent years, migration has slowly changed family organization. These changes include (1) the transfer of productive land tenure rights, responsibilities, and knowledge to women; (2) reduced availability of family labor; and (3) an increase in the average age of active producers. </description>
