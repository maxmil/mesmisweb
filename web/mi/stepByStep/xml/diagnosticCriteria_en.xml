	<literal>Efficiency</literal>
	<description>Generally, efficiency refers to a ratio of returns to investment. For example, the ratio of the value of a market product to its production cost, or the achievement of an objective at the maximum quality possible with the minimum resource consumption. It can also be a form of measurement of the ability of a person, organization or process to fully perform a designated task at a given time. Efficiency can be measured for economic activities as well as for administrative, cultural, or environmental processes of a management system. The most efficient systems have lower impacts on their resource base.</description>

	<description>Conservation indicates a systemâ€™s capacity to prevent degradation of its structure and function, and of the resource base that sustains it. Conservation not only refers to the environmental aspects, but also to economic and social aspects, such as the capacity to save and maintain desired goods and services, or the conservation of traditional knowledge and practices. Conservation requires practices, technologies and resources to restore management systems, as well as to prevent their degradation. </description>

	<literal>Distribution of costs and benefits</literal>
	<description>This criterion refers to the equality of distribution of costs and benefits of productive activities. Historically, this has been one of the main problems of traditional models of resource exploitation, where profits are maximized and concentrated for one sector at the expense of others who receive fewer benefits and pay the negative consequences. Distribution of costs and benefits must be evaluated both within the system and at subjacent scales.</description>
