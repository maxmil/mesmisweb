    <h1>THE <strong>MESMIS</strong> FRAMEWORK</h1>
    <div class="separator"></div>
    <div class="section">
      <a name="1.1"></a>
      <h2>BACKGROUND</h2>
      <p>Despite the extensive discourse on sustainable development, there have been few consistent and systematic attempts to transform the general principles of sustainability into operational practices under actual field conditions.  Traditional analytical approaches (e.g., cost-benefit analysis) have proven insufficient or simply inadequate at incorporating constraints - such as the existence of non-aggregate or non-quantifiable variables, or the integration of biophysical parameters within social and economic processes - into analyses of sustainability.</p>
      <p>The problem has been attempted to be fought by an additive efforts, that is to say, by adding conventional techniques. Nevertheless, a deep analysis of sustainability requirements implies a qualitatively different conceptual and practical effort. Particularity, there are not many development frameworks for the evaluations of management systems of natural resources in the farmer context of the third world countries. There is a relatively wide area of work in the development of the biophysical-type indicators, especially for very concrete subsystems in controlled conditions (sustainability indicators of land resource or for determinate sowing). There are also already-existing wide-scale studies on development of economic indicators, mainly directed to the commercial agriculture conditions. Even so, there has not been enough work in the incorporation of social and institutional criteria and in complete management systems (for example the agrosilvopastorile systems), nor has their been enough long-term work, as in the case of forestry systems. </p>
      <p>On the other hand, the sustainability evaluation proposals are normally under very general and relaxed frameworks, designated for fast evaluations, or on detailed proposals that can be performed only under experimental conditions. There are still some missing efforts for the establishment of evaluation frameworks that are truly operative in field conditions that would be simultaneously based in a rigorous evaluation of sustainability. </p>
      <p>Finally, the sustainability analyses are generally classified by factors (e.g. if the system is or is not sustainable). The development of procedures to improve the socio-ecological profile of diverse management systems and under-analysis technologies. has yet to be achieved. </p>

      <h2>WHAT IS THE MESMIS? </h2>
      <p>The Framework for the Evaluation of Natural Resource Management Systems Incorporating Sustainability Indicators (in Spanish <strong>M</strong>arco para la <strong>E</strong>valuaci√≥n de <strong>S</strong>istemas de <strong>M</strong>anejo de recursos naturales incorporando <strong>I</strong>ndicadores de <strong>S</strong>ustentabilidad, MESMIS) is a methodological tool that: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Assists in evaluating the sustainability of natural resource management systems (NRMS), with an emphasis on small farmers and local contexts (from the level of the farm to the village)</li>
        <li>Generates critical analyses aimed at improving the likelihood of success for any proposed alternative NRMS as well as for already existing NRMS under evaluation. MESMIS is a process of  <em>analysis and feedback</em>. which avoids a simple ranking of management systems in terms of a <em>sustainability index or scale</em>.</li>
        <li>Seeks an integral understanding of the opportunities and constraints for the sustainability of NRMS that are forged by the intersection of environmental processes and socio-economic conditions </li>
        <li>Evaluates the <em>comparative</em> sustainability of management systems, either by comparing one or more alternative systems with a system of reference, or by observing changes in the properties of a particular system over a period of time</li>
        <li>Promotes an evaluation process that is systemic, participatory, multidisciplinary, and flexible, which can adapt to different levels of data availability and local technical and financial resources. </li>
        <li>Constitutes a tool in development, in which the experience of applying the methodology will improve the very model on which it is based. In this sense, it should be understood that MESMIS functions as a method for organizing a discourse on how to make the concept of sustainability operational in the field.  </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>TO WHOM IS IT DIRECTED? </h2>
      <p>The MESMIS is directed to research institutions, nongovernmental organizations and producers involved in the design, development and the diffusion of natural resources management systems. </p>

      <h2>STRUCTURE AND PRINCIPLES </h2>
      <p>The main objective of MESMIS is to bring a methodological framework for evaluation thesustainability of different natural resource management systems in local scale (property,productive unit, community).  Being part of the following suggestions: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Sustainability is defined by five general attributes of natural resource management systems: (a) productivity, (b) stability, trust and resilience (c) adaptability, (d) equity and (e) auto-dependence (auto gestation). </li>
        <li>Evaluating sustainability is valid only in the context of: (a) specific management systems ina given geographical location and in a given social and political context; (b) a specificallydefined spatial scale (property, production unit, community or basin); and (c) a determinedtime scale.</li>
        <li>Evaluating sustainability is an interdisciplinary and participatory process. The evaluationteam must include both external evaluators and direct stakeholder (agricultures,technicians, community representatives and other actors)</li>
        <li>Sustainability cannot be evaluated per se. It must be measured as a comparison of or relation between systems. There are two ways to achieve this: (a) by comparing the evolution of a single system over time; or (b) by simultaneously comparing one or more alternative or innovative management systems with a reference system (transversal comparison). This makes a fundamental difference with other frameworks as the FESLM (FAO, 1994). </li>
        <li>The evaluation of sustainability is a cyclic process aimed at strengthening theeffectiveness of both the management systems and the evaluation methodology itself.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Operatively, for formalizing the general proprieties, the strengths and weaknesses are defined in a series of critical points for the sustainability of the management system that is related to three evaluation areas: environmental, social and economic. The diagnostic criteria and indicators are defined in each evaluation area. This mechanism assures a clear relationship between the indicators and the characteristics of agro-ecosystem sustainability. (See the diagram 1)</p>
      <p>Finally, the obtained information by the different indicators is integrated using multi-criteria analysis techniques, with the purpose of giving a judgment of value to the management systems and bringing suggestions for the improvement of its socio-environmental profile.</p>

      <p align="center">Diagram 1. Operative structure: the relationship between attributes and indicators</p>
      <p>To apply the methodology, an evaluation cycle is proposed, which is formed by the following elements or steps (See the diagram 2):</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Determinating the evaluation object. In this step the management systems that would be evaluated are defined as well as their characteristics and the socio-environmental context of evaluation.</li>
        <li>Determinating the strengths and weaknesses that could affect the sustainability of the management systems that are being evaluated.</li>
        <li>Selection of indicators. Here the diagnostic criteria are determined and the strategic indicators are derived in order to realize the evaluation.</li>
        <li>Indicators measurement and monitoring. This step includes the design of the analysis instruments and the desired information to be gathered.</li>
        <li>Results presentation and integration. Here the sustainability of management systems are compared, the principal obstacles for the sustainability are indicated as well as the characteristics that further aid.</li>
        <li>Conclusions and recommendations. Finally, in this step a synthesis of the analysis is made and suggestions are proposed to fortify the sustainability of the management systems, as well as to improve the evaluation process itself.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Having covered these six steps, the conceptualization of the systems and the aspects that need to improve would be advanced, in order to make them more sustainable; with this the new evaluation cycle will be started.</p>
