      <h2>WHAT IS THE MESMIS PROJECT?</h2>
      <p>The MESMIS Project is an impelled and directed effort by professionals and researchers from different areas who are interested in the development and spread of the tools for the evaluation of the sustainability of natural resources management systems. The project objectives are focused in the development of the Framework for the Evaluation of Natural Resource Management Systems Incorporating Sustainability Indicators (MESMIS) as in its application in case studies across the rural sector, mainly in farmers contexts of Latin America. Furthermore, it is looking to train individuals and organizations interested in evaluating the sustainability and formation of human resources through graduate an undergraduate university programs.</p>
      <p>To break with the common problem that the theoreticaldevelopments are applied just a few times inthe concrete society problems resolution (in our society concrete problems resolution) the project was designed to cover four main fields: research-train-apply-document. This, at the same time, gave place to four notable strongly integrate action areas: 
</p>
      <h3>1. Research in emergent topics of sustainability</h3>
      <p>where it is sought to contribute elements for the concepts development and tools for the evaluation, as well as a critical analysis of the opportunities and challenges that still exist for the operation of the sustainability concept. The different thematic areas where it has been deepened are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The trends analysis in the sustainability evaluation</li>
        <li>The characterization of managing systems</li>
        <li>Sustainability Indicators</li>
        <li>Integration of Sustainability Indicators</li>
        <li>Multi-scale Analysis</li>
        <li>Dynamic Systems</li>
        <li>Decision-making</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>2. Application and systemization of case studies</h3>
      <p>The systemizing experiences in theapplication of the MESMIS framework has been one of the principal concerns of the project. The case studies document how themethodology has been applied in diverse systems, ecological contexts and socioeconomic situations, from the southern tip of South America to the Iberian Peninsula. Among these experiences there are case studies of small-scale wine production systems in Argentina and Portugal, diversified multi-level ecological production in the Andes and communal management of forests and jungles, silvo-pasture agroforestry systems and small-scale ranching in Mexico.</p>
      <h3>3. Human Resources Formation</h3>
      <p>This area has been a pillar of the MESMIS project and has helped to train an ample group of persons with a new approach to themulti-dimensionality of natural resources management and its associated ecosystems. It has tried to cover diverse educational spheres:university undergraduate and graduate programs in Mexico and Spain, international courses and training workshops forcivil servants, technicians and rural promoters. </p>
      <h3>4. Generation of reference materialsfor public information</h3>
      <p>The MESMIS project is also creates reference materials to provide theoretic and methodological bases for understanding the concept and evaluatingsustainability in order to promote its discussion and use. This materials include publications in the form of refereed articles, books, reports and working documents, as well as the database SUSTENTA, which includes a group of selected references on sustainability and its evaluation. </p>

      <h2>PRINCIPAL RESULTS</h2>
      <p>Since its first edition in 1999, the MESMIS project has had a significant impact:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>More than 40 case studies  in Mexico, LatinAmerica and Spain (shown on map)</li>
        <li>More than 30 publications,diverse refereed articles and books, handbooks, articles for the general public, and support documents.</li>
        <li>More than 40 courses, workshops and seminars taught in LatinAmerica.</li>
        <li>Participationin 15 undergraduate and graduate programs in Latin America.</li>
        <li>More than 500 national and international references on sustainability systemized in the database SUSTENTA.</li>
        <li>Collaboration in international teams including the FAO FESLM project.</li>
        <li>•	Development of MESMIS Interactive, didactic,user-friendly and interactive simulation software, about how to apply the MESMIS framework.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>PARTITIPANT INSTITUTIONS</h2>
      <p>One of the objectives of theMESMIS project was the consolidation of a multi-institutional and interdisciplinaryresearch team, where institutions and organizations involved in natural resources management come together. This group now consists of four academic institutions and one civil organization: The Ecosystems Research Center(CIECO-UNAM), Environmental Geography Research Center(CIGA-UNAM), Research Center in Agriculture Sciences (CICA-UAEM), College of the Southern Borderland (ECOSUR) and the Interdisciplinary Group of Appropriate Rural Technology (GIRA, A.C.) </p>
      <p>This group collaborates in graduate courses in different universities, training workshops, in the generation of reference material and documents as well as in national and international publications. Also, all members adviseundergraduate and graduate theses and dissertations as well as local, national and international studies. </p>
      <p>Simultaneously, each member keeps close ties with institutions in Latin America, Spain, Holland and France, mainly in the education field. This contributes tocreating a space for exchangingacademic as well as sustainability evaluation experiences. </p>
      <p>The formation of this research team has helped to strengthen the theoretical bases of sustainability evaluation and its application in concrete experiences. Today, it is in a stage of consolidation and its objective is to improve the conceptual and practicaltools to be usedby different agents involved in natural resources management.  </p>
